# The Repository of Misfit Rust

Here there be broken toys written in the rust programming language.

I thought that a monorepo to toss all of the weird one off experiments and
learning pieces I write would be cool.  I also though it would it would be fun
to name it after (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_and_the_Island_of_Misfit_Toys].
So, that's what this is.  A bunch of toy experiments that are more likely to be
broken nonsense than anything useful becaused I wanted to play with something
and then move on.
